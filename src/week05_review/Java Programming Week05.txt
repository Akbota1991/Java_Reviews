Method: a function
 
    Syntax:
                                      (MUST)       (MUST)
        Access-Modifier  Specifier  Return-Type  methodName(Parameters){

                // Code Fragments

        }

        Access Modifiers: public, protected, default, private

                    public: Always accessible

        Specifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized

                    static: can be called through class name

        Return-Type: void, any data type

                    void: can not return any value from the method
                    not void: method MUST return a value

        method name: any name

        Parameters: any data type

                    a data the method MUST have otherwise the method can not perform its task




Tasks
    1. Create a method named calculate that accespt three arguments:
            1. num1 (double)
            2. operator (char)
            3. num2 (double)

        if the operator is +:
                the method should return the addition of the two numbers

        if the operator is -:
                the method should return the subtraction of the two numbers

        if the operator is *:
                the method should return the multiplication of the two numbers

        If the operator is /:
                if denominator is NOT zero:
                    then the method should return the division

        for any other operators, the method should return 0

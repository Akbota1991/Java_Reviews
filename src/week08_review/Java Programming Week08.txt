Tasks:
    1. Write a program that can return the first unique elements from an arraylist

            Do not use indexOf & lastIndexOf methods


    2. Write a program that can remove string elements from an arraylist if the firt and last characters of the string are same
    ex:
        list = {"Anna", "Canada", "Bob", "David", "Lan", "Abida", "Ebrahim", "Farida"}
    output:
        ["Lan", "Ebrahim", "Farida"]


    3. write a program that can return the nth largest number from an arraylist
            ex:
                arraylist = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,8}
                n = 5
            output:

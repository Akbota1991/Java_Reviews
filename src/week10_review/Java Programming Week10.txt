Pizza Task:
    Create class named CydeoStudent:
                private variables:
                    size, numberOfCheeseTopping, numberOfPepperoniTopping

                Encapsulate all the fields
                        Conditions:
                            1. size of the pizza can only be set to small, medium, large (case insensitive)
                            2. Number of cheese topping can not be negative, the maximum number of cheese topping is:
                                        small: 3
                                        medium: 4
                                        large: 5

                            3. Number of pepperoni topping can not be negative, the maximum number of pepperoni topping is:
                                        small: 4
                                        medium: 5
                                        large: 6

                Add a constructor that allows user to set all the fields when the object is created.
                                (If the arguments not valid it should not be set to the instances)

                Methods:
                    calcCost(): returns the totalCost of the pizza
                    toString():returns a String containing the pizza size, quantity of each topping, and the pizza cost as calculated by calcCost()

        Pizza cost is determined by:
                        S: starts at $10 
                        M: starts at $12
                        L: starts at $14 

                        Per pepperoni topping: 2$
                        Per cheese topping: 1$

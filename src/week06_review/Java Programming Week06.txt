Loops: Repeated Action
    
    For loop: When the repetition is fixed

                     i =0;  i < length
                for(init; condition; i++){
                    code
                }

                RemoveDuplicates



    While loop: When the repetition is NOT fixed
                repeated If
                
                while(Condition){
                    code
                }

                if(Condition){
                    code
                }


    Do-While loop: When the repetition is NOT fixed
                    Loop MUST be executed at least once


                do{
                    code
                }while(Condition);
